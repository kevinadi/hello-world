/*
 MongoDB Capture the Flag setup script
 
 This file sets up three challenges using MongoDB, the user to complete the last challenge, captures the flag.

 The exercises progress in difficulty from easy to hard, the answer to the last exercise is the password to the next exercise.

 How to run the script:

 mongo admin -u madmin -p mongoctf ctf_setup.js

 Requirements:
   - mongod process running with authentication (mongod --auth)
   - A user in the admin database with the following credentials for the root role: madmin/mongoctf:

   db.getSiblingDB("admin").createUser({
       user: "madmin",
       pwd: "mongoctf",
       roles: [ "root" ]
     });
